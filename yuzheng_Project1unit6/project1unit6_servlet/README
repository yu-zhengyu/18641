How to Run the project

1. Import these two projects into Eclipse
2. Run the server first(server.Server.java)
3. Then run the client (client.CarModelOptionsIO)
4. Use this client to upload several car model so that the servlet has something to present.
5. Add the projectunit6_servlet project to your Tomcat server, and open the Tomcat
6. visit the following page: http://localhost:8080/projectunit6_servlet. And you can see the pages that show the information about the car models which are just uploaded by the client to the server.
