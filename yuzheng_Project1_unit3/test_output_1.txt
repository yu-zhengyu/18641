This is the test file, first time, we remove synchronized method to do the Object Locking usage. And then we run the routine serval times, and pick up one of them. 

For this test, we modify the updateOptionPrice function. We change it as each time we update the option price, it would add $1000 for this item. And we change the transmission automatic option item 3 times, it should be 3000 in real, but it only add $2000 finally.
